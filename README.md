## Background Information
Heart disease is a significant health concern leading to various complications and, in severe cases, death. This project aimed to integrate machine learning techniques with a Public Health Dataset to assist in identifying influential factors and tests for heart disease diagnosis. The analysis was conducted on an anonymized dataset from Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V in 1988. The objective was to explore if machine learning models could aid doctors by predicting patients who might require further investigation for potential heart diseases.

## Tasks Undertaken:

1. Research and Dataset Exploration

* Conducted initial research on the heart disease dataset.
* Preprocessed the data, illustrating the outputs of the three pre-processing phases.
* Visually analyzed the processed data, highlighting essential findings.
* Explained the preprocessing methods and provided a descriptive analysis justifying the chosen approach.

2. Naïve Bayes Classifier Implementation

* Evaluated the performance for disease classification using the Naïve Bayes classifier.
* Applied Naïve Bayes to classify potential heart disease patients.
* Assessed the results and accuracy of the Naïve Bayes classifier.
  
3. Logistic Regression Implementation

* Applied logistic regression using gradient descent for disease classification.
* Compared the performance of various gradient descent methods (batch, mini-batch, stochastic).
* Displayed training, validation, and test loss over 30 epochs.
  
4. Comparative Analysis of Models

* Utilized specific evaluation metrics and explained the reasoning behind their choice.
* Compared the performance of the Naïve Bayes and Logistic Regression models.
* Analyzed and discussed which model provided the highest score and the reasons behind it.
  
5. Bonus Task: Naïve Bayes Classification

* Utilized Naïve Bayes classification for a hypothetical scenario to predict whether a person can buy a computer or not based on provided features.

## Dataset Access and Tools Used:

The heart disease dataset was obtained from Kaggle (Link: Heart Disease Dataset | Kaggle).
Open-source libraries such as scikit-learn (SK-learn), NumPy, Seaborn and Pandas were primarily used for data processing and analysis.

## Conclusion:
The project involved comprehensive data analysis, preprocessing, model implementation, and evaluation using machine learning techniques, aiming to assist in heart disease diagnosis. The findings and evaluations provide insights into potential factors influencing heart disease identification and the effectiveness of various machine learning models in classification tasks.
